# stonks
A project designed to automate the downloading of data to determine if a stonk has "a good brand name" as well as determining if a stock is under or over valued.

TODO:
 - statistics to determine if stock are valued high or low(DCF[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp] and these other ones[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101316/how-tell-if-stock-overvalued-or-undervalued.asp])
    - if the statistic is best compared to others in it's industry the SEC offers a simple way to do that will explain later 
 - analyze each of the companies on the list with other financial indicators

FIX:
 - fix x axis issues 
 - get nasdaq and usd valuation(as of now kind of annoying af)

 - treasury interest rate api for DCF
 - 10Q-net cash flow, profit, growth of profit DCF ex:(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872423000012/amzn-20230630.htm)
